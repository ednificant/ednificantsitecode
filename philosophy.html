	<h1>Design Philosophy</h2>
		<article>
			<h2>Software Applications Developer</h2>

		<p>What is good Software/Application Development? Software/Application Development takes a lot of the mind to use.
	You have to have the creativity, the passion, and the precision within the masterpiece you make. I gladly take my
	time execute every singular task I have because it’s all about the quality of the work, not the quantity. If I
	were to worry about the quantity of work, it would show that I have done more but it doesn’t show the effort put
	in to these projects.</p>

		<p>Important parts within the Software/Application Development career path is that you stay focused and do not grow indolent.
	I personally try to stay motivated by not overworking myself. I think of an average human as a volcano it stays calm if
	nothing bothers it, but if I were to annoy it or pressure it, it would explode and would have to take days or weeks to
	cool down or to reestablish itself to its normal form. Whenever I feel the need to take a break I do because it doesn’t
	make me overwork my mind to where I become more indolent. Patience and motivation is key within this career field.</p>

		<p>When it comes down the creation of anything, not just with software/application development. I honestly think creating
	anything takes pride, creativity, and precision within the making. I could picture anything that takes creativity and picture
	it as a canvas. Now I think of having a painting utensil and paint. While I delicately dip my brush into the paint, I would
	take the time to be accurate with my brush and be steady to make the masterpiece. I don’t think too much or little of the canvas,
	I like to keep neutral, keeping it balanced makes everything calm and balanced.</p>

		<p>Last but not least is the affection and enthusiasm of the masterpiece. I show as much affection to the masterpiece so it can look
	as precise and perfect as it can. I tend to recycle a lot of projects when I don’t like them than I would start from scratch.
	Sometimes tend to look back at my mistakes and fix them within the piece itself. In my case I think of mistakes not being an option,
	although I still don’t make a big deal if they are made. I also tend to show my affection and love towards my work because I don’t
	look at it as just work. I look at it as something that can be built such as a baby. Treat a baby right, love it, and control it in
	good ways and it will come out good. If I were to do the opposite than my work would be worthless and come out to be negative and may
	deal me many negative outcomes. My favorite part is when you finish, execute, and take a look at the very thing you built up. It still
	familiarizes itself to a baby because once that baby grows up to the adult you wanted it to you take a good look and still tend to be
	positive although it could have taken a lot of stress and struggling.</p>
